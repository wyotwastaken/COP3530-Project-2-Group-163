Information for running code:
1. To access the dataset, go to this link: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove
2. Download "**NEW!!** 2024 Wikipedia + Gigaword 5 (11.9B tokens, 1.2M vocab, uncased, 100d vectors, 560 MB download):"
3. Rename the file "word_list.txt"
4. Drop the file into the resources->data folder.
5. Open main in the resources->src folder to run the program. IGNORE old_src_1 and old_src_2.
6. You must wait for the words/vectors, Ball Tree, and KD-Tree to be initialized when running main().
7. After each tree is done loading, you will be prompted to enter a word, and then prompted to enter an integer.
   Note: the first input is using the Ball Tree KNN search.
8. IMPORTANT: make sure your word input is completely lowercase, or else it will not be found from the dataset.
9. Press '0' to exit the Ball Tree KNN search into the KD-Tree KNN search.
10. The prompt window will be the same as before, type a word and an integer to list the top semantically similar words.
11. Press '0' again to end the program.
